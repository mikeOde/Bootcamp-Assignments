To start, this collection holds data about the instructors in a single faculty. So our main concern is the Instructors. After reviewing the table I found the following errors:
-	The table title: Faculty is wrong
-	The first two rows of the table are so terrible that they gave the faculty a first and last name.
-	The degree field in this design accepts comma separated data which is unacceptable.
